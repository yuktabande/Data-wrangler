1. **Data Quality Check: Missing Values:** Check for missing values in `Table1` (columns "NNR" and "Product Manager") and `Table4` (column "Brand").  Impute missing values or remove rows as appropriate.  Also check for missing values in `Mapping` (columns "Month" and "Month num").

2. **Data Cleaning:  Standardize Month Names:** In sheets "Qlik1", "Saksham query1", and "Saksham query4", standardize month names (e.g., "Jan" to "January").  Use a mapping table if necessary.

3. **Join Operations:**
    * Join `Qlik1` and `MDO Analytics+KisanConnect` on "Division" to analyze sales performance against MDO activities.
    * Join `Saksham query1` and `Saksham query2` on "Division", "Event type", and "Month" (after cleaning month data) to compare planned vs. actual event outcomes.
    * Join `YTD Liquidation` and `Rabi Liquidation` with `Table1` on "Brand" to analyze liquidation volume by brand and division.

4. **Data Aggregation: Pivot Table:** Create a pivot table from `Qlik1` with "Division" as rows, "Month" as columns, and "Sales achieved (Rs)" and "Sales target (Rs)" as values to summarize sales data by division and month.

5. **Data Aggregation: Summarize Saksham Data:**  Aggregate `Saksham query4` and `Saksham query5` (after removing unnecessary columns) by "Division", "Event type", and "Month" to get total planned and achieved values for each event type.

6. **Outlier Check:** Analyze "Liquidation Actual Volume (KL / MT)" and "Liquidation Target Volume (KL / MT)" in "YTD Liquidation" and "Rabi Liquidation" for outliers using box plots or scatter plots. Investigate any significant deviations.

7. **Visualization: Sales Trend:** Create a line chart from the pivot table in step 4 to visualize sales trends over time for each division.

8. **Data Enrichment:** Join `Table2` and `Table3` on "Division" and "Season number" to add crop information to seasonal data.  Then join the result with `Table4` on "Crop" to link crops to brands.
