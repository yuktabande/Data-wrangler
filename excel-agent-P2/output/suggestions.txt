1. **Data Quality Check: Missing Values:** Check for missing values in columns "NNR" (Table1) and "Product Manager" (Table1), "Crop" (Table3), and "Brand" (Table4).  Impute or remove rows as appropriate based on the nature of the missing data.

2. **Data Cleaning: Inconsistent Month Names:** Standardize month names across all sheets (e.g., "January" instead of "JANUARY").  Use a mapping table or a consistent formatting function.

3. **Join Operations: Sales and MDO Data:** Join "Qlik1" and "MDO Analytics+KisanConnect" on "Division" to analyze the relationship between sales performance and MDO activities.

4. **Join Operations: Saksham Events:** Join "Saksham query1" (Planned) and "Saksham query2" (Actual/Achieved) with "Saksham query5" on "Division", "Event type", and "Month" to compare planned vs. actual event performance.  Clean and standardize "Month" column first.

5. **Join Operations: Liquidation and Brand Details:** Join "YTD Liquidation" and "Rabi Liquidation" with "Table1" on "Brand" and "Division" (or "Division_transform") to get detailed brand information alongside liquidation data.

6. **Pivot Table: Sales Performance:** Create a pivot table from "Qlik1" with "Division" as rows, "Month" as columns, and "Sales achieved (Rs)" and "Sales target (Rs)" as values to summarize sales performance by division and month.

7. **Visualization: Sales Trend:** Create a line chart from the pivot table in step 6 to visualize the sales trends over time for each division.

8. **Outlier Check: Liquidation Data:** Analyze "YTD Liquidation" and "Rabi Liquidation" for outliers in "Liquidation Actual Volume (KL / MT)" and "Liquidation Target Volume (KL / MT)" using box plots or scatter plots. Investigate any significant deviations.  Consider using a log transformation if data is heavily skewed.
